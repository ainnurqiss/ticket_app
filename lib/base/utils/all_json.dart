These views include a wide range of urban elements such as city skylines, roads, landmarks, and architectural structures, depending on the roomâ€™s location and elevation. Each window is constructed with insulated, double-pane glass to reduce noise and maintain room temperature while allowing for uninterrupted visual access to the surrounding cityscape. Guest rooms offering city views are available in multiple configurations and sizes, with window placement designed to align with the overall layout of each room. In addition to private views from guest accommodations, shared areas such as lounges, dining spaces, and designated observation points are also designed to provide clear and direct sightlines of the urban environment. All viewing areas are cleaned and maintained regularly to ensure transparency and guest satisfaction. The inclusion of city views is a consistent feature throughout the property and is available upon request at the time of booking, subject to room availability and floor level.',
